# incr

An [Atom](https://atom.io/) package to increment and decrement the number under the cursor.

### Default Keybindings
```cmd-ctrl-k``` to increment by 1  
```cmd-ctrl-K``` to increment by power(10, position)  
```cmd-ctrl-j``` to decrement by 1  
```cmd-ctrl-J``` to decrement by power(10, position)  

### Whatchout!
- Still working on specs
- If you incr .9 it becomes .10
- If you decr .0 it becomes .-1
